This To-Do List App allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks, mark them as complete with a single click, delete individual tasks using the close (×) icon, and clear all tasks at once. The app uses localStorage to save tasks even after the page is refreshed, ensuring a persistent user experience.
